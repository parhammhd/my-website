## Projects

Here are a couple of my projects. Iâ€™ll be expanding this page as I work on and share more!

---

### [Zapri](https://github.com/parhammhd/zapri){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

A work-in-progress Android browser for alternative, small-scale internet protocols like Gemini, Gopher, Spartan, and more. Built with Kotlin and Material 3, Zapri aims to be lightweight, respectful of users' privacy, and accessible for those interested in decentralized web browsing.

> ðŸ“¦ *Technologies:* Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3, Gemini/Gopher protocol parsing  
> âœ¨ *Status:* Early development â€” more updates soon!

### [This Website](https://github.com/parhammhd/my-website){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

The source code for [parham.dev](https://parham.dev) itself â€” a minimalist, fast, privacy-friendly personal site built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. This project reflects my interests in clean web development and self-hosting.

> ðŸ“¦ *Technologies:* Eleventy, Markdown, Simple.css, custom Nunjucks templates  
> ðŸ“Œ *Highlights:* Static, fully self-hosted, no JS required for core functionality

More projects will appear here over time â€” stay tuned!
