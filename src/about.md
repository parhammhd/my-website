Hello there! I'm **Parham**, a software engineer born in **1994**. Iâ€™m passionate about building things on the web and always exploring new technologies to make the digital world a better place.

### ðŸš€ **My Journey**

I started my path in the world of technology with a degree in **Software Engineering**, where I honed my skills in coding, problem-solving, and building scalable systems. Over the years, Iâ€™ve found my niche in **web development**, and I've become particularly fascinated by the **smolweb** movementâ€”creating fast, minimal, and lightweight web experiences.

Iâ€™ve spent time working on various projects, from personal blogs to more complex systems, learning something new with every line of code. I thrive on challenges and always try to find creative solutions to technical problems.

- **Web Development**: The web is my playground! From full-stack development to **smolweb** principles, I love creating experiences that are fast, intuitive, and elegant.
- **Smolweb**: A philosophy of building the web with minimalism and performance in mind, aiming for websites that are clean, fast, and efficient.
- **Learning Foreign Languages**: I enjoy learning new languages, both human and programming! It broadens my mind and helps me connect with people and ideas across the world.
- **Tech Communities**: Sharing knowledge and collaborating with others is a big part of who I am. Iâ€™m always keen to be a part of tech communities and contribute wherever I can.
